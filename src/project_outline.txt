* use cin to process an image into a Feature 2D vector bool vector[28][28]
* Create image class that stores the feature 2D vector and truth label of an image
* use a vector to store all images

OR

* create class ImageData that contains 2D feature vector and a vector of labels
* Since the image file corresponds with the labels file, the indices of the vectors should match up

create 4D array of probabilities [28[28][10][2]
